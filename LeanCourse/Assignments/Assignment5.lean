/-! # Exercises to practice. -/

/- A note on definitions -/

lemma my_lemma : 3 + 1 = 4 := rfl
def myThree : ℕ := 3

/-
Tactics like `simp` and `rw` will not unfold definitions unless instructed to.
Tactics like `exact` and `apply` will unfold definitions if needed.
Uncomment the following lines one-by-one to see the difference. -/

example : myThree + 1 = 4 := by
  -- rw [my_lemma] -- fails
  -- simp [my_lemma] -- fails to use `my_lemma`
  -- exact my_lemma -- works
  -- apply my_lemma -- works
  -- rw [myThree, my_lemma] -- works after instructing `rw` to unfold the definition
  -- simp [myThree] -- works after instructing `simp` to unfold the definition
                    -- (it doesn't need `my_lemma` to then prove the goal)
  sorry


/- The following exercises are to practice with casts. -/
example (n : ℤ) (h : (n : ℚ) = 3) : 3 = n := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n m : ℕ) (h : (n : ℚ) + 3 ≤ 2 * m) : (n : ℝ) + 1 < 2 * m := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n m : ℕ) (h : (n : ℚ) = m ^ 2 - 2 * m) : (n : ℝ) + 1 = (m - 1) ^ 2 := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n m : ℕ) : (n : ℝ) < (m : ℝ) ↔ n < m := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n m : ℕ) (hn : 2 ∣ n) (h : n / 2 = m) : (n : ℚ) / 2 = m := by {
  sorry
  }

example (q q' : ℚ) (h : q ≤ q') : exp q ≤ exp q' := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n : ℤ) (h : 0 < n) : 0 < Real.sqrt n := by {
  sorry
  }

/- Working with `Finset` is very similar to working with `Set`.
However, some notation, such as `f '' s` or `𝒫 s` doesn't exist for `Finset`. -/
example (s t : Finset ℕ) : (s ∪ t) ∩ t = (s ∩ t) ∪ t := by {
  sorry
  }

example {α β : Type*} (f : α → β) (s : Finset α) (y : β) : y ∈ s.image f ↔ ∃ x ∈ s, f x = y := by {
  sorry
  }

/- `Disjoint` can be used to state that two (fin)sets are disjoint.
Use `Finset.disjoint_left` (or `Set.disjoint_left`) to unfold its definition.
If you have `x ∈ t \ s` apply `simp` first to get a conjunction of two conditions.
-/
example {α : Type*} (s t : Finset α) : Disjoint s (t \ s) := by {
  sorry
  }


/- Let's define the Fibonacci sequence -/
def fibonacci : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0 => 0
  | 1 => 1
  | (n + 2) => fibonacci (n + 1) + fibonacci n

/- Prove the following exercises by induction. -/

example (n : ℕ) : ∑ i in range n, fibonacci (2 * i + 1) = fibonacci (2 * n) := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n : ℕ) : ∑ i in range n, (fibonacci i : ℤ) = fibonacci (n + 1) - 1 := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n : ℕ) : 6 * ∑ i in range (n + 1), i ^ 2 = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) := by {
  sorry
  }

def fac : ℕ → ℕ
  | 0       => 1
  | (n + 1) => (n + 1) * fac n

theorem pow_two_le_fac (n : ℕ) : 2 ^ n ≤ fac (n + 1) := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n : ℕ) : fac n = ∏ i in range n, (i + 1) := by {
  sorry
  }

example (n : ℕ) : fac (2 * n) = fac n * 2 ^ n * ∏ i in range n, (2 * i + 1) := by {
  sorry
  }





/- **Exercise**.
Define scalar multiplication of a real number and a `Point`. -/

@[ext] structure Point where
  x : ℝ
  y : ℝ
  z : ℝ

-- give definition here


/- **Exercise**.Define Pythagorean triples, i.e. triples `a b c : ℕ` with `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
Give an example of a Pythagorean triple, and show that multiplying a Pythagorean triple by a
constant gives another Pythagorean triple. -/

-- give definition here



/- Prove that triples of equivalent types are equivalent. -/

@[ext] structure Triple (α : Type*) where
  x : α
  y : α
  z : α

example (α β : Type*) (e : α ≃ β) : Triple α ≃ Triple β := sorry



/- 5. Show that if `G` is an abelian group then triples from elements of `G` is an abelian group. -/

class AbelianGroup' (G : Type*) where
  add (x : G) (y : G) : G
  comm (x y : G) : add x y = add y x
  assoc (x y z : G) : add (add x y) z = add x (add y z)
  zero : G
  add_zero : ∀ x : G, add x zero = x
  neg : G → G
  add_neg : ∀ x : G, add x (neg x) = zero

example (G : Type*) [AbelianGroup' G] : AbelianGroup' (Triple G) := sorry



/-! # Exercises to hand-in. -/

/- **Exercise**.
Define the structure of "strict bipointed types", i.e. a type together with 2 unequal points
`x₀ ≠ x₁` in it.
Then state and prove the lemma that for any element of a strict bipointed type we have
`∀ z, z ≠ x₀ ∨ z ≠ x₁.` -/

-- give the definition here

-- state and prove the lemma here


/- Prove by induction that `∑_{i = 0}^{n} i^3 = (∑_{i=0}^{n} i) ^ 2`. -/
open Finset in
lemma sum_cube_eq_sq_sum (n : ℕ) :
    (∑ i in range (n + 1), (i : ℚ) ^ 3) = (∑ i in range (n + 1), (i : ℚ)) ^ 2 := by {
  sorry
  }

/-
Suppose `(A i)_i` is a sequence of sets indexed by a well-ordered type
(this is an order where every nonempty set has a minimum element).
We now define a new sequence by `C n = A n \ (⋃ i < n, A i)`.
In this exercise, we show that the new sequence is pairwise disjoint but has the same union as the
original sequence.
-/
lemma disjoint_unions {ι α : Type*} [LinearOrder ι] [wf : WellFoundedLT ι] (A C : ι → Set α)
  (hC : ∀ i, C i = A i \ ⋃ j < i, A j) : Pairwise (Disjoint on C) ∧ ⋃ i, C i = ⋃ i, A i := by {
  have h := wf.wf.has_min -- this hypothesis allows you to use well-orderedness
  sorry
  }



/- Next, we'll prove that if `2 ^ n - 1` is prime, then `n` is prime.
The first exercise is a preparation, and I've given you a skeleton of the proof for the
second exercise. Note how we do some computations in the integers, since the subtraction on `ℕ`
is less well-behaved.
(The converse is not true, because `89 ∣ 2 ^ 11 - 1`) -/

  }

/- Prove that for positive `a` and `b`, `a^2 + b` and `b^2 + a` cannot both be squares.
Prove it on paper first! -/
lemma not_isSquare_sq_add_or (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
    ¬ IsSquare (a ^ 2 + b) ∨ ¬ IsSquare (b ^ 2 + a) := by {
  sorry
  }


/-- Let's prove that the positive reals form a group under multiplication.
Note: in this exercise `rw` and `simp` will not be that helpful, since the definition is hidden
behind notation. But you can use apply to use the lemmas about real numbers. -/

abbrev PosReal : Type := {x : ℝ // 0 < x}

def groupPosReal : Group PosReal := sorry



/-
Compute by induction the cardinality of the powerset of a finite set.

Hints:
* Use `Finset.induction` as the induction principle, using the following pattern:
```
  induction s using Finset.induction with
  | empty => sorry
  | @insert x s hxs ih => sorry
```
* You will need various lemmas about the powerset, search them using Loogle.
  The following queries will be useful for the search:
  `Finset.powerset, insert _ _`
  `Finset.card, Finset.image`
  `Finset.card, insert _ _`
* As part of the proof, you will need to prove an injectivity condition
  and a disjointness condition.
  Separate these out as separate lemmas or state them using `have` to break up the proof.
* Mathlib already has `card_powerset` as a simp-lemma, so we remove it from the simp-set,
  so that you don't actually simplify with that lemma.
